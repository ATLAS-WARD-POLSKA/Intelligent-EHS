Intelligent EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) System on the Construction Site

One of the core values of Atlas Ward is to ensure the highest standards of occupational health and safety on construction contracts, both for our own employees and those of our Partners. We are seeking a solution that will provide us with knowledge and enable preventive and rescue actions, particularly focusing on:

**Monitoring presence and counting people**: delivering real-time information about the number of people currently on the construction site for potential evacuation needs, with the ability to distinguish between our own employees and the employees of individual Partners.

**The solution may additionally cover the following areas:**

1. Predicting, detecting, and alerting about unusual human behavior: 
- The system should recognize and alert about human behavior that deviates from the norm or pattern, which may indicate possible health problems, such as fainting or heart attacks.

2. Predicting, detecting, and alerting about unusual machine behavior: 
- The system should recognize and alert about machine behavior that deviates from the norm or pattern, which may indicate possible technical problems or improper use or security, such as excessive tilting, unsecured hooks, or excessive emission of exhaust fumes.

3. Recognizing and alerting about potentially dangerous situations: 
- The system should detect and alert about the lack of appropriate protective clothing, working at heights without protection, person-vehicle collision risks, or unsecured earthworks.

4. Detecting and alerting about accidents: 
- The system should recognize and immediately alert about accidents to enable rapid emergency response. 

5. Detecting and communicating the exceedance of environmental work standards: 
- The system should detect and communicate excessive noise, poor air quality, or excessive vibrations.
